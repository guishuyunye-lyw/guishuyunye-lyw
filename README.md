### 🌱 Research Vision and Motivation  

I am deeply interested in the study of human learning, particularly in enhancing learning efficiency and quality, exploring the interaction between personal knowledge and the "third world" (as described by Popper), and contributing to educational equity. Over the years, my experiences have shaped my understanding and commitment to these goals.

Currently, my research focuses on meaningful learning and spaced learning. I believe that optimizing learning intervals to foster creativity and deeper comprehension is a practical and valuable approach. In an era increasingly influenced by AI, encouraging individuals to engage in 'deep learning'—going beyond rote memorization and procedural knowledge—is more important than ever.

My recent work involves using EEG to capture moments of insight and track neural representational changes during repetitive learning. I find great joy in designing experiments, especially when inspired by the gap between theory and real-life experiences. I strive to create experiments with high ecological validity and, whenever possible, offer participants a meaningful learning experience.

While my research is driven by curiosity and a desire to contribute, I remain aware that there is always more to learn. I approach my work with humility, knowing that progress often comes from collaboration and continuous reflection.

I warmly welcome anyone who shares an interest in these topics to connect with me. I would be delighted to exchange ideas, explore potential collaborations, and learn from each other's perspectives.
